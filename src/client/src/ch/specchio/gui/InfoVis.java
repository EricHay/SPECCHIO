// This class serves as an interactive data visualization and analysis tool. Much like Kibana or Tableau, the visualization
// will try to adapt to the provided data. Creating interesting visualizations. The interactivity includes filtering,
// zooming, brushing and linking, machine learning techniques, data analysis techniques, data manipulation techniques
// and data export techniques.
public class InfoVis {
    // Include functionality from SpectralDataBrowser
    // Include a data selection based on range sliders and other available info, which get their values from asking the DB about min and max or possible values (e.g. if strings)
    // Include drag and drop of data from selection onto visualization pane
    // Include check the hierarchical level of the dropped data. Split visualizations per unit and sensor
    // Include band selection if not the whole spectrum is of interest
    // Include interactive data selection - brushing and linking, zooming, parallel coordinates, box plot, violin plot,
    // Include metadata information visualization and or presentation
    // Include color visualizations per campaign - allows to compare campaigns
    // Include data manipulation - normalization
    // Include data analyses - machine learning, pca, mds, etc.
    // Include data export - selection of data as CSV
    // Include data export comes with a report - selection criteria (e.g. campaign(s), researcher(s), metadata selections)
    // Include data amount checker - if too many spectra are selected, a warning pops-up, that it might take a long time to load. ...
    // Then start by showing a selection of the data while the other data loads in the background.
