## Introduction

SPECCHIO was originally built by the Remote Sensing Laboratories at the
University of Zurich, and extended by Intersect for the School of Earth and
Environmental Sciences at the University of Wollongong.

SPECCHIO consists of a Java web application for accessing a central database of
spectral data, and a Java client application for viewing and manipulating data
managed by a SPECCHIO server. The web application is designed for use with
GlassFish 3.1.2.2 or later and MySQL 5.0 or later.

Please refer to the [user guide][user-guide] for information on how to install
and use SPECCHIO.

The original code of the ANDS DC10 project is also available on
[GitHub][IntersectAustralia]
